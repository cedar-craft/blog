# Cedar: What, Why, How?

[Cedar](https://www.cedarpolicy.com/en)
  is a new system for
  expressing and checking
  [authorization policies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authorization).
As a programming languages researcher,
  Cedar's [technical innovations](https://www.amazon.science/blog/how-we-built-cedar-with-automated-reasoning-and-differential-testing) in
  verification-guided development and
  automated-reasoning-powered analysis
  caught my attention.

But, big picture ... who really needs
  *yet another* technology
  sprinkled into the zoo of
    HTML, CSS, TypeScript, SQL,
    React, Node.js, Django, Rails,
    Docker, Lambda, etc.?
Why would you squeeze
  *yet another* phase into
  the development process?

Cedar is definitely worth
  designing for and deploying
  if your application has
  **"scale or stakes"**:
- Huge applications need
    a systematic way to manage authorization
    across enormous numbers of
    roles, operations, and resources.
- Critical applications need
    a rigorous way to analyze critical policies
    and ensure only safe access is allowed.

Of course,
  Cedar can also be great choice for
  smaller, less critical applications --
  big critical systems often grow out of
  smaller low-stakes experiments!
Plus,
  the Cedar ecosystem is growing rapidly;
  we're still discovering what the
  best design patterns are across domains.
We are constantly hearing from
  ever more users who find that incorporating Cedar
  reduces overall complexity and makes it easier to
  grow and maintain their applications with confidence.
